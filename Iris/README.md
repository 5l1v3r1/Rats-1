# Iris
# Description
Iris is an adjudicational Trojan & a fullon RootKit, Targeting windows machine's, maid for Research purposes<br>
And as a resource Kit for ethical hackers.
we begin with delivery methods, anti-virus evastion and continue on to local acceleration of privileges in order to get a privileged persistent on the target machine. in this Repo we will try to simulate a full on root-kit throw hiding our persistence mechanism of action and simulating a real targeted campaign against any company or retailer.
i do not supply any binary's for any of the Rat components, nither forge certificate's or native executable's.
on the other hand i will try to give as much information as possible on how to avoid getting hit by this kind of exploit, and ll' try to supply as many open resources as possible to implement your own tool, for ethical hacking purposes, and for anti-virus software writers.
